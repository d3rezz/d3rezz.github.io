I have been listening to the podcasts posted by [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast.aspx) almost every week now for the past months. On each episode, DJs are invited to bring their own mix and the music played ranges from techno and house to hiphop.  These are usually hot DJs in the scene and as such these podcasts are great to find new music.

The last four mixes are always available to download as mp3, however any mixes before that can only be streamed from Soundcloud (with compressed audio quality). 
By carefully crafting the url, we can still find the original mp3 file in RA's website.

I wrote a python script to download all mixes so that I could listen to them while offline. You can get the code and check out how it works on [my Github](https://github.com/d3rezz/resident_advisor_podcasts_downloader).
