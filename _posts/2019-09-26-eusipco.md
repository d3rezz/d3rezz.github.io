Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to present my first paper, titled "Efficient Feature Extraction for Person Re-Identification via Distillation", at the EUSIPCO 2019 Signal Processing conference in A Coru√±a, Spain.

Being able to discuss my findings with other Computer Vision researchers was a very rewarding experience and I collected some amazing feedback and ideas to try next.

The conference proceedings will soon be available in the IEEE platform.

Here is the view from the conference centre every morning.
