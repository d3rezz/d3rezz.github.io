Got my first paper accepted in the EUSIPCO 2019 conference in A Coru√±a! It is titled "Efficient Feature Extraction for Person Re-Identification via Distillation" and includes the results of my Masters' thesis. This study involved optimizing the deep learning feature extraction module in a person re-id pipeline for faster inference. In the end, the proposed model was three times faster and deployed successfuly in real use case.

See you all there!
